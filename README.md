## **Project Description**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of having a stroke based on their health conditions and lifestyle factors. 
By analyzing the relationship between various health attributes and the occurrence of strokes, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in the healthcare domain. The findings can contribute to improving stroke prevention strategies and promoting better health outcomes for individuals at risk.
This information can be valuable for healthcare professionals in implementing preventive measures and early interventions.
